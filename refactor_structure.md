Below are some higher-level structural and architectural recommendations to improve maintainability and scalability of your codebase. These suggestions focus on organizing the logic into smaller, more modular components and preparing the code for future enhancements or changes.

### Key Opportunities for Improvement

1. **Separate Data Persistence from UI Code**:  
   Currently, reading and writing persistent data (notes) is done directly within the widget (`notepadwidget.lua`).  
   **Refactoring Idea**:  
   - Create a dedicated data module, for example `scripts/notepad/data_manager.lua`, responsible solely for:
     - Loading and saving notes via `TheSim:GetPersistentString` and `TheSim:SetPersistentString`.
     - Abstracting away the persistence logic so the UI code only needs to call `data_manager:LoadNotes()` and `data_manager:SaveNotes(content)`.
   This decouples the UI from the persistence layer, making it easier to change how you store or load data (e.g., adding encryption, changing file names, or switching to a different storage mechanism) without touching the UI logic.

2. **Encapsulate Input and Key Handling**:  
   Input handling and key bindings (for toggling the notepad, saving, and navigation) are spread across `modmain.lua` and `notepadwidget.lua`.  
   **Refactoring Idea**:  
   - Move all keybindings and input-related logic into a single input-handler module, or at least consolidate them in `notepadwidget.lua` using small, well-documented methods.
   - If multiple widgets or features are planned, consider a general input utility module to avoid cluttering the widget code with too many conditional branches.
   
3. **Use Constants and Configuration Files**:  
   Values like widget sizes, line widths, font sizes, and keybind defaults are hard-coded in multiple places. For instance, `LINE_WIDTH = 450` and `font_size = 25` are defined inline in code.  
   **Refactoring Idea**:  
   - Create a `scripts/notepad/config.lua` file that exports constants and default settings (e.g., `DEFAULT_LINE_WIDTH`, `DEFAULT_FONT_SIZE`, `AUTO_SAVE_INTERVAL`).
   - Reference these constants from both UI and data modules, ensuring updates are centralized.  
   This approach makes it easy to tweak dimensions, timing, or text limits without hunting through multiple files.

4. **Modularize Complex Widget Logic**:  
   The `NotepadWidget` currently handles: 
   - UI layout (frame, background, title, close button)
   - Dragging and mouse events
   - Text editing logic (OnTextInput, OnRawKey)
   - Saving/Loading from persistent storage
   - Timers (auto-save, save indicator)
   
   **Refactoring Idea**:  
   - Extract dragging logic into a small utility class or a mixin (e.g., `draggable_widget.lua`) if you plan on having other draggable components in the future.
   - Move text formatting or advanced editing logic (like automatic line-break insertion) into a separate utility module. For instance, `scripts/notepad/text_utils.lua` could handle measuring text width, wrapping text, and inserting line breaks.  
   
   This leads to smaller, testable chunks of code and a cleaner `NotepadWidget` that focuses mainly on assembling components and orchestrating their interactions.

5. **Improve Scalability by Anticipating Future Features**:  
   If you intend to add more features—such as multiple tabs, search functionality, formatting options, or syncing notes between players—preparing your code now can help:
   - Consider wrapping the editor logic in a separate class (`NotepadEditor`) that just focuses on text input and retrieval. The `NotepadWidget` would then delegate all text operations to `NotepadEditor`.
   - A `NotepadEditor` class could handle `OnTextInput` overrides, line-break logic, and cursor navigation cleanly. This would make it easier to add features like "undo/redo" or line highlighting later on.

6. **Consistent Coding Practices and Comments**:  
   - Add clear, consistent comments for each section of the code:  
     - Document what each module does.  
     - Explain the responsibilities of each method and any special logic (like line-wrapping behavior).
   - Consider a uniform naming convention for variables and functions. For example, use `snake_case` for local variables and `PascalCase` or `CamelCase` for classes and methods, following Lua best practices or your project’s chosen style.

7. **Testing and Mocking**:  
   While not directly related to code structure, thinking about testing can drive good structural decisions.
   - If you create separate modules for data handling and text utilities, you can more easily write automated tests (even if outside the DST environment) to confirm that line wrapping, saving/loading, and other logic works as intended.
   - Keeping UI code separate from logic also makes it easier to test logic in isolation.

### Summary of Proposed Structural Changes

- **`scripts/notepad/data_manager.lua`**: Handles loading and saving note text from persistent storage.
- **`scripts/notepad/config.lua`**: Stores constants like default widths, heights, font sizes, and auto-save intervals.
- **`scripts/notepad/text_utils.lua`** (optional): Contains helper functions for measuring text width, inserting line breaks, and other text manipulation tasks.
- **`scripts/notepad/notepadwidget.lua`**: The main widget, now simplified to:
  - Construct the UI.
  - Delegate data operations to `data_manager`.
  - Delegate advanced text logic to `text_utils` (if needed).
  - Handle only the top-level UI events (focus, show/hide, dragging).
  
- **`modmain.lua`**: Remains focused on mod initialization, hooking up the input key handler to the widget toggle function, and referencing the newly refactored modules as needed.

By introducing these structural improvements, the code will become more maintainable, easier to navigate, and more amenable to adding new features or scaling up the complexity of the notepad functionality.
