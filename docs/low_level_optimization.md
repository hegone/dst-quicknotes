# **Low-Level Implementation and Optimization**

## Safe Function Overriding
- Preserve the original function before modifying:
  ```lua
  local _old_fn = SomeComponent.SomeFunction
  function SomeComponent:SomeFunction(...)
      _old_fn(self, ...)
      -- Custom logic here
  end
  ```
- Use `UpvalueHacker` to modify local functions when necessary.

## Advanced Memory Management
- Use **table pooling** for frequently created objects.
- Clean up event listeners when entities are removed:
  ```lua
  inst:RemoveEventCallback("event", callback_fn)
  ```

## Optimizing Critical Code Paths
- Use **batch processing** for large entity updates.
- Reduce per-frame logic by leveraging scheduled tasks:
  ```lua
  inst:DoTaskInTime(0, function() end) -- Defer execution to the next frame
  ```

## Handling Engine Constraints
- DST is **single-threaded**; avoid expensive calculations in one frame.
- Use `GetTime()` instead of per-frame counters for time tracking.
- Minimize **network traffic** by aggregating NetVar updates.

By applying these **low-level optimizations**, mods can maintain high performance and stability in DST.
